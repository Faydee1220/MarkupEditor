<h1>Welcome to the MarkupEditor Demo</h1>
<h6>Version 0.1</h6>
<p>The file you're looking at is just a simple HTML file that includes all the kinds of elements supported by the MarkupEditor by default. This document also serves as a brief tutorial on using the MarkupEditor as an end-user, along with some information for developers.</p>
<h2>Styles</h2>
<h4>Overall Document Styling</h4>
<p>When you load an HTML document into the MarkupEditor, the document is styled using markup.css. In this demo, you can use the <i>File</i> toolbar above to examine the raw HTML of this demo.html document. You will see it is "clean" in the sense that it contains no embedded attributes like style, font, or sizing. The overall document styling is up to you as a developer (and it's my intent to have it easily customizable). When your end users see the word <i>Style</i> in the toolbar, it refers to paragraph style.</p>
<h4>Paragraph Style</h4>
<p>This is a <i>Normal</i> style paragraph. There is a title at the top at the top of this document that uses an <i>H1</i> style. As you select in the text, the toolbar indicates the paragraph style of the element you selected.</p>
<p>A style applies to a block of text. The MarkupEditor supports the standard HTML styles of <i>P</i>, <i>H1</i>, <i>H2</i>, <i>H3</i>, <i>H4</i>, <i>H5</i>, and <i>H6</i>. Styles cannot contain other styles. So, for example, you can't embed an <i>H3</i> style in an <i>H1</i> style header.</p>
<p>The toolbar refers to <i>P</i> style as "Normal". The notion of a style is not native to HTML (even if it is to CSS), but it's pretty well understood by every person who has ever used a word processor, spreadsheet, or even the most primitive text editing tool these days.</p>
<h4>Lists</h4>
<p>The MarkupEditor supports both numbered and bulleted style lists. The should behave like you would expect, maintaining the list style and progressing through the proper markers on sub-lists. You can switch styles using the toolbar and change styles within lists.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Here is a bulleted list.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Here is a numbered sublist.</li>
            <li>With two items.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>The bulleted list has two items and a sublist that is numbered</li>
</ul>
<h4>Indenting</h4>
<p>Like the other styles, indenting applies to a block of text, although you can indent both normal paragraphs and headers. Once you indent, the toolbar enables the outdent button. You can indent multiple times, and you can outdent until there is no more indenting to outdent.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><h5>Here is an example of a header that has been indented twice.</h5></blockquote></blockquote>
<h2>Formats</h2>
<p>Text can be formatted to present as <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underline</u>, <code>code</code>, <del>strikethrough</del>, <sub>subscript</sub>, or <sup>superscript</sup>. Unlike styles, formats can be combined; so for example, a <b><i><u>bold, italic, underlined</u></i></b> section of text works just fine.</p>
<h2>Inserted Elements</h2>
<p>You can insert and edit links, images, and tables in the document. Each of these elements requires some kind of user input to create them. The MarkupEditor exposes an additional element-type-specific toolbar for each of these elements when you create or edit them. To edit one of these elements, select an existing link, image, or table, and then expose the toolbar for that element.</p>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>To insert a <a href="https://github.com/stevengharris/MarkupEditor">link</a>, you need to start by selecting some text to link-to. When you've done that, the link button is enabled, and when you select it, the link toolbar appears below. Enter a URL and <i>Save</i>. <i>Cancel</i> just closes the toolbar, leaving the original text/element unchanged. You can leave the toolbar open as you select other elements in the text, which allows you to view and/or edit existing elements more easily. To delete an existing link, clear out the URL and press Save.</p>
<h4>Images</h4>
<p>Images have to be inserted at a point in some text, or at the beginning or end of some text. If you have text selected (i.e., one or more characters of text), the <i>insert image</i> button is disabled. When you have the cursor at a point in text, press the <i>insert image</i> button to expose the image toolbar. To insert an image in this version of the MarkupEditor, you need to specify a URL. You can (and should!) provide additional descriptive text to go along with it, which is the right thing to do for people with visual impairment. You can scale the image to make it smaller and fit better in your document.</p>
<p>Here is an inline image: <img src="https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/34783542/290b5fe4078e031aef18e02c7bd9103f.png" alt="Markup > Markdown" tabindex="-1">. Select it and then press the image button to see its URL, alt text, and scale settings.</p>
<p>Again, you can <i>Save</i> your changes or <i>Cancel</i>, closing the toolbar. You can leave the toolbar open to view other image elements. To delete an image, you can clear out the URL and press <i>Save</i>.</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Tables have to be inserted at a point in some text or between paragraphs. As in the case for images, if you have text selected (i.e., one or more characters of text), the <i>insert table</i> button is disabled. When you have the cursor at a point in text, press the <i>insert table</i> button to expose the table toolbar. The <i>create table</i> button on the left side lets you create a table with the number of rows and columns you want. Once you have created the table, or you select a table in the document you're editing, the <i>create table</i> button is disabled. In other words, you cannot insert a table into a table.</p>
<p>The Add buttons in the table toolbar let you add a header at the top of the table or add rows/columns above/below the point you have selected in the table. The delete buttons remove the row/header you have selected in the table. To remove the header, select inside of it and press the remove row button.</p>
<p>Here is a placeholder straight from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table">HTML docs</a> so it's easy to play with.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">The table header</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The table body</td>
            <td>with two columns</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>I'm not particularly happy with the table formatting at this point. I think proper table support really requires text justification and an ability to hide/show borders. For example, there are two columns, but you cannot tell.</p>
<h2>Undo/Redo</h2>
<p>The <i>undo</i> and <i>redo</i> buttons should do what you expect and are also accessible via the menu and hot-keys. There is currently a bug that may make the insertion caret disappear when you perform undo using a hot-key like Ctrl-Z. Right now only the formatting (bold, italic, etc) and paste operations are properly undo-able.</p>
<h2>Extending the MarkupEditor</h2>
<p>The File toolbar is part of the demo, but not part of the core MarkupEditor. The MarkupToolbar does not include the FileToolbar you see in the demo. Check out the ContentView in SwiftUIDemo and ViewController in the UIKitDemo to see details of how it was done. The demo starts with some initial HTML taken from demo.html. You can open a different html file to see how it behaves. You can also toggle a view of the raw HTML off-and-on from the File toolbar. The raw HTML updates as you edit the document, to show what the MarkupEditor is doing behind the scenes. Note that normally (i.e., when using the MarkupEditor outside of the demo), typing is a very lightweight operation. Because the demo is set up to update the raw HTML as you type, it's a bit more heavyweight in the demo.</p>
<p>The demo makes use of the <code>leftToolbar</code> option in the MarkupToolbar which makes it simple to add your own toolbar to the left (and/or with <code>rightToolbar</code> for the other side) of the standard MarkupToolbar. You can just as easily construct your own toolbar in SwiftUI using using the toolbar-level views like StyleToolbar and FormatToolbar, or with the LabeledToolbar and ToolbarButtons used within them.</p>
