/// The MarkupStateHolder must be a class that conforms to ObservableObject.

/// Since the MarkupToolbar can be used to interact with multiple MarkupWebViews or MarkupWKWebViews,
/// someone has to hold onto the selectedWebView and selectionState so that the MarkupToolbar knows
/// how to keep its display properly updated and how to invoke operations against the selectedWebView.
/// The MarkupStateHolder needs to specify @Published on its selectedWebView and selectionState.
/// 
/// For UIKit, MarkupStateHolder can be a UIViewController or whatever makes sense.
/// For SwiftUI, MarkupStateHolder can be held as a class property of ContentView or your @main App.
/// For unit tests, the test instance can be MarkupStateHolder and MarkupEventDelegate
